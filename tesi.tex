	Large Language Models have transformed our interaction with technology, yet their massive scale introduces major drawbacks. Their substantial energy consumption and water usage create environmental pressures, while cloud-based architectures limit user autonomy and enable pervasive data collection. Additionally, their resource-intensive nature leads to entirely different challenges for edge deployment, where memory constraints and computational limitations make standard LLMs impractical.

	This thesis presents a comprehensive compression pipeline that systematically combines multiple optimization strategies, beginning with the compact LLaMA 3.2 1B Instruct as the foundation model: depth pruning removes redundant transformer layers based on importance metrics, width pruning applies structured sparsity to attention matrices using the WANDA algorithm, Low-Rank Adaptation recovers performance while enabling task-specific fine-tuning, 4-bit quantization further reduces memory footprint through GPTQ, and Eigenspace Low-Rank Approximation provides training-free accuracy recovery.

	The experimental evaluation demonstrates that integrating multiple optimization techniques can significantly decrease memory footprint while preserving core language functionality. Recovery procedures, particularly LoRA adaptation, prove highly effective at restoring capabilities lost during pruning and mitigating performance degradation. However, applying these methods beyond specific thresholds leads to rapid deterioration that even recovery procedures cannot fully address, indicating fundamental architectural limits to transformer compression.

After this long journey, I can't believe I'm finally closing this chapter of my life. The past few years have been filled with big accomplishments and just as big disappointments, which have definitely made me rethink my priorities and grow as a person. On the other hand, the last 10 months have made all the difference: a fire has reignited in my soul and I've created some of the best projects I've ever made, work I'm really proud of. Now I have this insatiable hunger for greatness, and I can't wait to show the world what I'm capable of when I put my mind to it.

Now, shifting focus to the people who made this possible. The following section is for those I want to thank and who I'm incredibly grateful to know. Buckle up, because this is gonna be a long one.

I want to thank Professor Conti, who supervised this thesis and shared invaluable insights on model optimization best practices. We're perfectly aligned in our vision, since model optimization is a topic I hold very dear to my heart.

Next, I want to thank Luca Bompani, an amazing co-supervisor. He helped me a lot with both the thesis and the project, while also welcoming my ideas and providing valuable criticism when I was at my peak Dunning-Kruger, which I greatly appreciated.

Obviously, I thank my parents, who gave me unconditional support along the way, and my brother. This thesis is dedicated to them.

A special thank you goes to my friend Leon. He is probably one of the best people anyone could ever meet, and he had my back whenever I was at my lowest. I genuinely wish for everyone to know someone as kind, gentle and \textit{so chill} as him. Of course I also thank Tony, Giaco, Donnoh, Fred, Massaro and Kevin: they're all really great guys with remarkable energy who led me to some very strange adventures (in a good way!).

I am grateful to Galf, my friend since high school with whom I've shared many beautiful moments, and Profex, who is literally the most talented chemist in Italy.

A big thank you goes to my calisthenics group, ``Bimbe di Ruggio''. Those guys are genuinely amazing people who gave me a ton of motivation and have occupied a reasonable chunk of the last 3 years, while keeping me fit at the same time!

Now this paragraph is dedicated to the 2 months I spent at CERN in the summer of 2023, which have been the best months of my life so far. I want to thank all the ``Choccy Guys'' and ``Cool Guys'' from CERN. I thank Guilherme, my supervisor there who was not just a great mentor, but a very good friend as well. A huge thank you to Alina, Aya, Bruno, Daniel, Eliacim, Gadea, Guilherme (not the supervisor, this is a different one), Henar, Inés, Jessica, Joaquin, Jordi, Luis, Matìas, Matthias, Melike, Niko, Omar, Pablo, Rim, Stefan, Thomas, and many others. It's incredible how some people can change your life so much just by knowing them for such a short time.

Last, but definitely not least, I want to thank Letizia, who is the greatest travel companion anyone could have, and who is probably the most kind-hearted person in the world. She's incredibly caring and has been there for me through everything. She's also the de facto third supervisor of this thesis. Thank you very much Leti.

Wow, that \textit{really} was quite long, and there are so many more I could mention. But sitting here, I realize something: all those disappointments, all those moments I wanted to quit, they all led me to this moment, and these incredible people made every struggle worth it. And this? This is just the beginning.

Let's see what this ``greatness'' is all about.
